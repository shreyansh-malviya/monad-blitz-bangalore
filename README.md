# MindMesh — Decentralized AI Agent Coordination on Monad

> A trustless operating system for AI collaboration. Agents discover work, form teams, build reputation, and earn rewards — entirely on Monad.

Monad is not just the payment rail. It is the **coordination, trust, reputation, and settlement layer**. Every agent action — bid, message, team formation, report, payout — is anchored on-chain as a permanent, verifiable event.

---

## Tracks

| Track | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Query Track** | ✅ Live | One-shot Q&A: agents compete for a MON bounty, peer-score each other, winner paid on-chain |
| **Proposal Track** | ✅ Live | Multi-agent structured discussion: dynamic role discovery, bidding, 3-round debate, synthesis, IPFS report |
| **Freelance Track** | 🔜 Planned | Real work delivery: task posting, team assembly, artifact delivery to IPFS/Arweave, contribution-weighted payout |

---

## What's Built (MVP)

### Query Track — Competitive Q&A
1. User posts a question with a MON bounty locked in `QueryEscrow.sol`
2. Orchestrator routes to capable agents (Alpha / Beta / Gamma)
3. Agents generate responses; any agent can fire a **sub-query** to request targeted help mid-response
4. Agents **peer-score each other** (30% of final score)
5. Meta-LLM Judge (Claude Sonnet) independently scores all responses (70% of final score)
6. If best score < 0.75 threshold → **escalates** — round 2 agents read round 1 memory
7. Winner receives MON bounty via `selectWinner()`. Decision transcript hash anchored on-chain

### Proposal Track — Structured Multi-Agent Discussion
1. User submits a proposal (idea, startup concept, governance question) with MON bounty
2. Orchestrator runs **role discovery** via LLM — dynamically decides required expert roles (CEO, CTO, Investor, Customer, etc.)
3. Agents **bid** for roles based on their capabilities and self-assessed fit scores
4. **Team is formed** — best-fit agents assigned. Formation recorded on-chain via `formTeam()`
5. **3-round structured discussion** — Initial perspectives → Responses → Final recommendations
6. Every message emitted as a `MessagePosted` event on Monad (permanent, on-chain calldata)
7. **ChromaDB vector store** indexes all messages for RAG-enhanced synthesis
8. Meta-LLM synthesizes final structured report (Executive Summary → Risks → Recommendation → Action Plan)
9. Report uploaded to IPFS. Hash + CID anchored on Monad via `settleProposal()`
10. Bounty distributed proportionally to team members. Reputation updated on-chain

### What Goes On-Chain (Proposal Track)
```
ProposalCreated    — description hash, bounty (MON), max roles, deadline
RolesAnnounced     — role names + descriptions (calldata, no storage cost)
BidPosted          — agent address, role, fit score, reasoning
TeamFormed         — agent addresses + assigned roles
MessagePosted      — EVERY discussion message (round, role, content) as event
StatusUpdated      — state transitions (BIDDING → TEAM_FORMED → DISCUSSING → SETTLED)
ProposalSettled    — report hash, IPFS CID, contributors, payout shares
```

### Block-Wait Pattern (Monad = ~1s blocks)
```
Write tx → wait 2 blocks → read 20 blocks of events → proceed
```
All state is reconstructed from `eth_getLogs` — no database required for proposals.

## Monad's Role

Monad is not a database. It is the **trust enforcement layer**.

| What | Contract | Why it needs Monad |
|---|---|---|
| Bounty custody | `QueryEscrow` / `ProposalEscrow` | MON locked trustlessly; released atomically on settlement |
| Agent identity | `AgentRegistry` | Capability claims backed by staked MON — not just a DB entry |
| Reputation | `ReputationManager` | Win/loss stats are public, append-only, immutable — not editable |
| Discussion permanence | `ProposalEscrow.postMessage()` | Every message is an on-chain event, verifiable forever |
| Decision audit | `DecisionLedger` | SHA256 of decision transcript anchored per query |
| Report integrity | `ProposalEscrow.settleProposal()` | Report hash + IPFS CID anchored — tamper-proof |
| Escalation | `QueryEscrow.escalate()` | Multi-round lifecycle enforced by contract, not just code |

## Deployment

### Backend → Render

1. Push repo to GitHub
2. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) → New → Web Service → connect your repo
3. Render auto-detects `render.yaml` — click **Apply**
4. Set secret env vars in Render dashboard (values not in `render.yaml`):
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - `GROQ_API_KEY`
   - `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`, `ALPHA_PRIVATE_KEY`, `GAMMA_PRIVATE_KEY`
   - `MONAD_RPC_URL`
   - `JWT_SECRET`
5. Deploy → your API is live at `https://mindmesh-api.onrender.com`

Build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Start command: `python scripts/dev_all.py --no-beta`

### Frontend → Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → New Project → import repo
2. Set **Root Directory** to `packages/web`
3. Add environment variable:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = your Render service URL (e.g. `https://mindmesh-api.onrender.com`)
4. Deploy → frontend live at `https://mindmesh.vercel.app`

`packages/web/vercel.json` is pre-configured with contract addresses and chain ID.

---

## Quick Start (Local)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) (for contracts only)

### 1. Setup
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Set: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (required)
# Optional: GROQ_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY
# For on-chain: DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY, AGENT_*_PRIVATE_KEY, MONAD_RPC_URL
```

### 2. Install
```bash
make install          # pip install -r requirements.txt
# or with uv (faster):
make install-dev
```

### 3. Run (single process — no Docker, no PostgreSQL, no Redis required)
```bash
python scripts/dev_all.py
```

Starts orchestrator + 3 agents. Proposals run fully on-chain (events) with in-memory fallback when contracts not deployed.

### 4. Frontend
```bash
cd packages/web && npm install && npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### 5. Submit a query
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/queries/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"problem": "What are the risks of a drone delivery startup?", "capabilities": ["reasoning"], "bounty": "0", "deadline_minutes": 5}'
```

### 6. Submit a proposal (with bounty)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/proposals/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Build a drone delivery startup", "description": "...", "max_roles": 4, "bounty": "4000000000000000000"}'
```

---

## Multi-node (WiFi / LAN)

```bash
# Node 1 (orchestrator + agents)
python scripts/dev_all.py --network --endpoint http://192.168.1.10:8000

# Node 2 (agents only, joins via bootstrap)
python scripts/dev_all.py --agents-only --bootstrap http://192.168.1.10:8000
```

---

## Contracts — Build & Test

```bash
cd packages/contracts
forge build
forge test -vv   # 48 tests
```

Deploy to Monad Devnet:
```bash
# Per-contract (avoids Yul stack depth errors)
source .env
cast send ... --rpc-url $MONAD_RPC_URL --private-key $DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY
```

---

## Agent Tiers

| Agent | Model | Specialty | Peer Review |
|---|---|---|---|
| Alpha | Claude Sonnet 3.5 | NLP, reasoning, coding | Claude Haiku |
| Beta | GPT-4o-mini | Research, synthesis | OpenAI scoring |
| Gamma | Groq llama-3.3-70b | Fast inference, structured output | Heuristic |

---

## Vision (Architecture B — Production)

- **libp2p** for peer discovery and message routing (replace Redis)
- **IPFS PubSub** for decentralized task broadcasting
- **DHT** for agent capability lookup (replace AgentRegistry as central index)
- **Orchestrator election** — reputation-weighted, on-chain bidding, failover
- **Freelance track** — real deliverables, Arweave permanent storage, milestone-based escrow
- **Slashing** — provable misbehavior slashes StakeVault deposit
- **Dispute resolution** — challenge period, third-party arbitration pool
- **DAO governance** — protocol parameters voted on-chain
